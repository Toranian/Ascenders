        <h2>Carrie Pakingstaff - Coach/Route setter</h2>

        Carrie began climbing through St. Mary's Secondary School and soon after joined a youth climbing
        team at the Ascenders. It has now been three and a half years since Carrie walked into the climbing
        gym and has had the opportunity to travel to Europe, nationals and many exciting places around
        Canada as a team member. These days Carrie helps climbers, from kids to adults, develop their skills
        as a part-time coach and by teaching introductory lessons.

        <h2>Cynthia Mendezo - Coach</h2>

        Cynthia started at the Ascenders as one of the original climbing team members, and she hasn't
        been able to leave since! After graduating from St Mary's, she gained her CGI Level II certification
        and has found her passion through coaching the Ascenders youth teams. When she is not coaching she
        can be found studying hard for her BA in Recreation and Health Education, or preferably traveling
        and getting outside whenever she can!
