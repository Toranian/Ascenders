Program Philosophy

 The philosophy that guides our programs is simple: The benefits of participation sport are not necessarily found in the
 results, but the values, self-image, friendships and active lifestyle learned along the way. 

We design all our programs with these principles in mind:

* risk management, respect and fair play;
* fundamental skills and technical mastery before performance and results;
* fun, friendship and community; and,
* inclusivity.


Long Term Athlete Development:

The Ascenders Youth Programs follows the Long Term Athlete Development model based on the stages of athletic development outlined 
by Sport Canada and Canadian Sport for Life.
