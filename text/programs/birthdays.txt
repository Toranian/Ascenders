Birthdays

Who wouldn’t love to hang off the walls on their birthday? For kids aged 6 and up, we provide staff, gear and a party place 
to celebrate. We charge $20 (tax included) per child for 2.5 hours of fun. The first hour and a half is for climbing; enough 
time to tire out even the most energetic birthday star. For the last hour, you can use our mezzanine area to open presents 
and have snacks. We even clean up afterwards. We book birthdays on the following times:

Saturdays and Sundays – 10 am, 12 pm, 2 pm and 4 pm
 

To book, please fill in this form and someone will get back to you to confirm your booking, take a deposit, and answer your 
questions. Or you can call us at 604-233-3882.
