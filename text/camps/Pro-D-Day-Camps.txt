will focus on new activities, and cater to each participant’s personal progression so as to not be redundant for repeat participants.

Participants should be prepared for outdoor activities, rain or shine. Wear athletic clothes and running shoes. Bring a water bottle, 
snack & lunch, sunscreen, and a hat.

received the camp fees.
